# A Short Story Research Survey Review of Multimodal Models 
In this repo, I review a survey research paper on the topic of large multimodal neural network models & I include all artifacts related to this individual short story assignment for my CMPE 297 course at SJSU. Specifically, I chose to review ['A Survey on Multimodal Large Language Models'](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.13549) by Yin et.al.
